# Classification- we use classification technique when our target is categorical in nature.
we use some algorithms to get better accuracy
#KNN(K-nearest neighbour)
In knn algorithem is based on distance metrics specially euclidean is used to measure distance.
when new data point come it check which category has more number of datapoints in the given distance that new data point will assign that categiry which has more simmiler points.

# Decision tree algorithm-
Tree like structure which has decision node and leaf node to select root node we use attribute selection method.
there are 3 types of attribute selection method - Information Gain,Entropy,Gini Index.
 
# SVM (support vector machine)
is use to seperate data using hyperplain

# Logistic Regression-
compute probability of each class of target variable.
using sigmoidal function and log loss

# Random forest-
collection of different decision tree.
last accuracy will be the most vote accuracy

# Imbalance dataset 
we use this technique when most of the dataset belongs to the one class and other class distribution is not uniform
we get high accuracy but model fail to capture minority class 
Under sampling, Over sampling and smote are three methods to get balance dataset
